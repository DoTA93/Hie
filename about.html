            <p>HIE (Haddington International Education) was founded when Noreen Lucey identified an opportunity to enhance university collaboration
            and student recruitment efforts by creating a local presence on behalf of universities in various regions globally.
            </p>

            <p>From working in the International Offices of colleges and universities, Noreen saw the need to provide support to universities
            that wanted to expand their network globally but did not have the time or resources to do so. Her time spent living overseas
            in Europe, Australia, China and Central America, reinforced the value of working on the ground to effectively manage a local
            network.</p>

            <p>Over the years, Noreen has been joined by like-minded people who understand the importance of international education in
            the region they live in, and HIE is now made up of consultants based in Europe, Middle East, and Asia.</p>

            <p>As a result, HIE has been able to develop and manage strong partnerships on behalf of universities and agencies across much
            of the globe and continues to evolve with ever-changing markets and student needs.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to improve the internationalization of campuses globally and the overall study experience of students overseas.
            We aim to approach international education holistically by working with students, academia, industry and social enterprises
            in the countries we are present in.</p>

            <!-- <p>The core reason of why we do this is to allow all students to experience international education, either by bringing international
            students to their campus or by supporting their study abroad experience. We work with universities and colleges across all
            regions, but also focus on working with institutions in regions that do not normally attract internationalization. We work
            locally with institutions, industry and government bodies to empower students to fulfill their dream of studying overseas.
            This is, and has always been at the core of what we do.</p> -->

            <p>Noreen has worked and lived abroad for much of her career and holds degrees in European Studies, Languages and International
            Relations.</p>

            <p>She has worked in the computer software, insurance, finance and real estate industry and accidentally stumbled across a career
            in International Education whilst living in Central America. She moved from Nicaragua to China where she spent several years
            developing a local network of agents and universities in East Asia.</p>
            
            <p>Now based in Europe, she enjoys working with European universities in creating opportunities for their students to study
            overseas. She currently facilitates partnership development for international institutions seeking to expand their footprint
            in Europe also.</p>
            
            <p>Her real passion, and that of the people she works with, is in sharing their international education experience to be more
            inclusive and enable more students to experience study abroad. Her team is constantly seeking to broaden student and faculty
            experiences overseas.</p>

            <p>Her dream career has led her to work with schools, colleges, universities and agents in much of the world and she finds inspiration
            in the people she works with and can’t imagine a more rewarding work.</p>
